If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User's account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.

You will promptly notify CrossCompute if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

### Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of CrossCompute. For example, you may be a member of an organization on CrossCompute with its own terms or license agreements.

Users are responsible for the acts of others utilizing their access to the Service, and will be held responsible for violations of the Service by their sub-users or persons who gain access to the Service using the User's access codes.

## User-Generated Content

### Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### Ownership of Content and Right to Post

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself, you agree that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post, and you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

### CrossCompute May Remove Content

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any CrossCompute terms or policies.

### License Grant to Us

Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, display, and execute your Content, charge users to execute your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

That means you're giving us the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our server can do things like parse it into a search index); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other users); execute it (when it has code like a notebook or tool); and perform it (when your content is something like music or video).

By submitting Your Content to the Website, excluding privately transmitted User Content, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit such User Content in connection with the Website, the Service and our (and our successors' and assigns') businesses, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Website or the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after your termination of your Account or the Service.

### License Grant to Other Users

Any Content you post non-privately, including notebooks, tools, and results, may be viewed by others. By setting your Content to be viewed non-privately, you agree to allow others to view and execute it (this means that others may make their own copies of your Content).

If you set your notebooks, tools, and results to be viewed non-privately, you grant each User of CrossCompute a nonexclusive, worldwide license to access your Content through the CrossCompute Service, and to use, display, execute, and perform your Content, and to reproduce your Content solely on CrossCompute as permitted through CrossCompute's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license.

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Website and/or the Service a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access any of your User Content that is available to such user on the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Content, including after your termination of your Account or the Service. By submitting any User Content to the Service other than on the Website, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform such User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service. For clarity, the foregoing licenses granted to us and our users does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

### Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in the License Grant to Us, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section.

To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant CrossCompute a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up right to (1) use the Content without attribution strictly as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section. We need these rights to allow basic functions like search to work.

### Private Content

Users may have private Content, which allow the User to control access to Content. CrossCompute employees only access private content when access is required for security or maintenance or for support reasons, and then only with the consent of the content owner. Because we respect your privacy in private repositories, you must respect the Terms of Service in everything you post to a private repository. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to remove them.

## Third Party Service

The Service may permit you to link to other websites, services or resources on the Internet, and other websites, services or resources may contain links to the Service. When you access third party resources on the Internet, you do so at your own risk. These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their operators. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource. It is your responsibility to protect your system from such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.

## Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on CrossCompute violates your rights, please contact us by emailing legal@crosscompute.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

## Dispute Resolution

Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you and CrossCompute agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: in the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to: (i) the Website; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Service; (iv) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement; or (v) any other dispute between you and CrossCompute, the party asserting the dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the dispute. Notice shall be sent (1) if to CrossCompute, Inc. at legal@crosscompute.com or (2) if to you at your last-used email address. Both you and CrossCompute agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.

## Mandatory Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and CrossCompute in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and CrossCompute agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CROSSCOMPUTE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

Despite the provisions of this section, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (ii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iii) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

Any arbitration between you and CrossCompute will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by electronic mail. The notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CrossCompute may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or CrossCompute must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, CrossCompute will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by CrossCompute in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.

YOU AND CROSSCOMPUTE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CrossCompute agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

If CrossCompute makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to CrossCompute's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to CrossCompute's address for Notice, in which case your account with CrossCompute will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
