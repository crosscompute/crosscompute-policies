## Information we collect about you and how we collect it

The personal data we collect depends on how you interact with us, the services you use, and the choices you make. We collect information about you from different sources and in various ways when you use our Service, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, third-party data sources, and data we infer or generate from other data.

We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics ("inferences"). For example, we infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP address.

### Information we collect from third parties

When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional.

## How we share the information we collect

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.

We share personal data as described below, including with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your personal data described above with the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:

### Public information

You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you're commenting on public projects, you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile. You can also update your project configuration to use your private email address. Please see more about email addresses in commit messages here.

Please note that if you would like to compile CrossCompute data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a CrossCompute user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from CrossCompute, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from CrossCompute or CrossCompute users.

### Third-party applications

We share your personal data with third parties when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on CrossCompute to share your personal data. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization's access log.

You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products" to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of CrossCompute. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it. You can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your CrossCompute profile.

### Organizations with which you engage

You may indicate, through your actions on CrossCompute, that you are willing to share your personal data. If you collaborate on or become a member of an organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data. When you accept an invitation to an organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see. Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account.

### Service providers

We share your personal data with service providers who process the information on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, security, and other similar services. While CrossCompute processes all personal data in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Such processing by service providers will be in compliance with applicable law including any relevant transfer mechanism.

### Affiliates

We enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems, when affiliates provide services on our behalf, or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service.

- protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;

## Your choices about how we use and disclose your information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

If you do not wish to have your email address used by CrossCompute to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt out by logging into the Service and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to support+legal@crosscompute.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions.

Proper access and use of information provided on the Service, including User Contributions, is governed by our terms of use.
