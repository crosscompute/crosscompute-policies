## Support Requests vs. Support Tickets
1. After each Training Session, the CrossCompute Analyst Consultant will log and communicate Support Requests to CrossCompute Content Creators and CrossCompute Platform Engineers.

CrossCompute Platform Engineers may need to update the CrossCompute Platform to resolve some Support Requests.

With Customer approval, a Support Request may consume more than one Support Ticket. The Customer can choose how to allocate their Support Tickets to prioritize resolution of Support Requests.
